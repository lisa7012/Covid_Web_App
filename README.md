# Covid Web App

A web interface that allows employees and patients to interact with a database containing information about people, hospitals, employees, test results, regions, etc. Employees are able to view, edit, add, delete these information. As for patients, if they are tested positive, they will fill out a form on the interface everyday for two weeks to keep track of their symptoms. Final project created for my COMP 353 - Databases class with a team of 4 members.
